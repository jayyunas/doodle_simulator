INTRODUCTION
------------

The Doodle Poll simulator has many different options for the kind of data
that is required by the user. Since Doodle data is not publicly available,
this is a simple tool that allows users to simulate numerous doodle instances.

 * For a full doodle poll:

REQUIREMENTS

No special requirements.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

All versions of the simulator have multiple aspects that can be toggled (e.g. # of voters, # of time slots, etc.).

* v1.0:
    Allows one basic instance of a doodle poll with singular default voting threshold

* v2.0:
    Each user has arbitrarily generated threshold

* v2.1:
    Capability to choose number of Doodle instances, compare OPT(I) to DDL(I)


FAQ

Q: What new features are expected to be added?

A: We hope to add increased data analysis from this tool -- including excel spreadsheets.
   Currently in the process of creating a system to visualize the extrapolated data sets.
